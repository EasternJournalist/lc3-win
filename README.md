# lc3-win
A  LC-3 assembler &amp; simulator (not official version) by cpp. LC-3 is referred to the book Introduction to Computing System by Yale N. Patt and Sanjay I. Patel. The assignment is from the ICS course in USTC taught by An Hong.

Even though there is only one project named "lc3-simulator", it can actually do what both simulator and assembler do. You can use commands in the program to assemble, simulator and debug you lc-3 program. 

You may refer to the PPT to get to know about how this simulator works. (Note that the ppt is only about simulator.)

# Features
The simulator supports TRAP, I/O and interrput and disassembling, all features of official LC-3 in windows and even more. It runs in command lines by provides a nice UI, which makes it even more convenient than those with GUI.

# Requirements
* This is an Codeblocks cpp project. But it doesn't really matter if you are not going to use codeblocks.
